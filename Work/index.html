            <h2 class="main-title__h2">Our company working more than 20 years on the bookbinding and restoration field</h2>
            <p>As a 20 year experienced conservator, Slava is confident to work with antique and new books in 
                cloth and leather bindings as well as maps and documents printed on paper.</p>
            <p>Slava began working with paper in 1997 when he was a student at the Holy Trinity Seminary Russian 
                Orthodox monastery at Jordanville New York accredited by State University of New York. 
                He got a job at the monastery bindery, where monks of the monastery taught me how to restore antique 
                religious books and how to bind the new ones. Since then books and paper became his passion.</p>
            <p>He mastered his abilities with the help of very experienced and well-known masters in this field 
                James Twomey professional bookbinder and conservator (professional associate of American Institute for 
                Conservation), Scott Kellar (independent professional bookbinder) who taught Slava blind and gold hand 
                tooling of fine leather bindings.</p>
